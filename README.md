# Furnish UI

Furnish UI is a proof-of-concept application that uses Azure openAI Codex to place objects into a 3D space. The application is designed to help users visualize how furniture and other objects might look in a room before making a purchase or rearranging their space.

## Getting Started

Visit https://yusuf.kaka.co.za/furnish_ui/ to see the demo. You can update the room and object parameters on the page manually and then, to get the AI's recommended layout, hit the "Invoke Layout Co-Designer" button. The AI algorithm will automatically adjust the size and position of the objects to fit the room.
